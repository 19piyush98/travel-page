      comment: 'Absolutely love this app! It is so helpful when planning my trips. I especially love the optimize route option. When I have all my information in place like my starting point and my ending point it is fabulous! I found it was worth it for me to buy the subscription to the app to use this feature. I especially love how it will suggest things to do if you don\'t have any plans. I do wish it had a braking option for travel between points of interest. But other than that I love the app!',

      comment: 'I have used several trip planning apps. This one by far is the best. The interaction between google maps makes the planning so much easier. Adding an adventure not in the app is also easy. Love the connection to Trip Advisor also. Everything is connected including booking a stay. Easy to use on phone, tablets and computer! Well thought through development!',
